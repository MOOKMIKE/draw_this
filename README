Pictionary type game created by Michael Anderson using node.js

At it's current state only the basic foundation of pictionary works. A person connects to the server and is given a canvas element to draw on.
Each following connect goes to a viewing page. Whatever the drawer draws is sent to the canvas on the view pages.

There are 6 files, all must be in the same directory. Run node canvas-server in your console and go to your browser.
